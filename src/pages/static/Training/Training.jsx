                                                <strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> We will begin by learning the importance of reconnaissance in the ethical hacking process. You will discover various techniques and tools used to gather information about target systems, such as footprinting, scanning, and enumeration.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <strong>Scanning:</strong> Next, we will delve into the scanning phase, where you will learn how to identify active hosts, open ports, and services running on target systems. You will explore popular scanning tools like Nmap and understand how to interpret scan results to assess system vulnerabilities.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <strong>Enumeration:</strong> Building upon the scanning phase, you will explore enumeration techniques to gather additional information about target systems, such as user accounts, shares, and network resources. You will learn how to leverage enumeration results to identify potential security weaknesses.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <strong>Exploitation Techniques:</strong> Finally, we will cover exploitation techniques, where you will learn how to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to target systems. You will explore common exploitation methods, including buffer overflow attacks, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.
                                            </li>
